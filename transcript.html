            <p>KATIE ONG: Welcome everyone uh- today we are going to be talking about the cultural influence of jazz during the Harlem Renaissance. Today we will be having two guests joining us: Ethan and Hannah.</p>
            <p>Jazz emerz-emerged from a mix of different African American music, like ragtime or blues. The Specific era of jazz we will be discussing is during the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural movement emerging in Harlem, in the 1920s. In this time period, African Americans were recreating themselves through music and art. Th-this was when jazz fisrt became popular but we will be getting more specific today with how, who, and what influenced it. First joining us is Ethan who will be talking about how jazz- jazz influenced culture, why don't you tell is a little bit about that Ethan?</p>
            <p>ETHAN BURRILL: Hey. So, during the 1920s, there was a genenration of young women who were influenced by jazz, and they were called flappers. So during this time, femininity standards were placed on women, and this generation wanred to defy those standards, and sort of rebel against their expectations. Part of this rebellion was listening to jazz music and they changed the way they dressed accordingly.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: So, what were some of the stylistic changes made?</p>
            <p>ETHAN BURRILL: Well, in order to make dancing easier, they adapted the style of their clothing and of their hair. This popularized shorter skirts and bob haircuts, both of which were easier to dance in than the typical long dresses and long hairstyles of the time. Flappers also stopped wearing corsets, which were very constricting, and bras became popular instead. This change allowed for more freedom in their movement. These styles made dancing easier and they were also a rebellion against femininity standards.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: In some ways, do you feel this relationship between dancind and-to jazz music and rebellion says something about the nature of jazz, or about how it was initially percieved by American society at the time?</p>
            <p>ETHAN BURRILL: Yes, I do. One thing that actually characterizes jazz is its free flowing, and improvised nature. This- I think this contrasts with what is often seen with classical music, where technical proficiency is more valued, and the musicians that perform it follow more rigorous rules. So, this can be seen to have effects on poetry at the time, and even genres of music that branched off from jazz. In the particular case of flappers, this aspect of jazz holds many similarities to the way that they acted and thought about the world. So Flappers were influenced by their desire to live in the moment and have fun, as opposed to following the expectations that were placed on them, such as getting married and starting a family.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: During this time period, uh-jazz grew a large white audience who would often pay lots of money to experience jazz in clubs. What sort of influence did white people have on the jazz industry?</p>
            <p>ETHAN BURRILL: Well, at this time The United States was very segregated between races, and many of these jazz clubs and record companies were owned and run by white people. Because of this we see many examples of record companies filterimg out jazz music that they deemed innapropriate for a white audience. While white people were enjoying certain brands of jazz in clubs, certain artists such as Billie Holiday sang about the struggles of African Americans in The United States. Columbia Records was her label at the time, and they actually refused to record one of her most popular songs, "Strange Fruit." This song describes the lynching of black people in the south, and describes their bodies as strange fruit hanging from trees.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: Alright, thank you Ethan for joining us here today, it was really interesting to hear from you.</p>
            <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "STRANGE FRUIT")</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: Alright, so our next guest is Hannah, who will be talking about how white artists often overshadowed black jazz artists.</p>
            <p>HANNAH HARTUNG: Hey thanks for having me.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: Of course lets get started.</p>
            <p>HANNAH HARTUNG: So, while I was researching, one thing I found that probably won't suprise you is that a lot of white people saw jazz as a form of black folk music, but what I discovered that came as a bit of a shock is that reputable black figures saw jazz music as a backwars, low form of expression.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: I think that's, um really interesting considering that jazz is a well received music genre today.</p>
            <p>HANNAH HARTUNG: Yeah, as I was digging deeper I wondered what brought on the connotation, and I found that it was the race factor. Reoutable blacks thought it was too close to their slave heritage, and they were trying to assimilate into white culture and leave their past behind.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: In my research, I found that the first recordings of jazz were actually from a white band, called the Original Dixieland Jazz Band.</p>
            <p>HANNAH HARTUNG: Yeah so, once white people learned that there was a profit factor in jazz music, they began to t- they began tolerate it more. As I believe Ethan briefly mentioned white people were in charge of the radio stations and recording labels so they decided who would make it in the industry, and so even though it was more of a commodity to white people, they were the ones who would make it big in jazz.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: I think it's really unfortunate that white people profited off of works that were made- origionally made by black people.</p>
            <p>HANNAH HARTUNG: Yeah the white artists became more famous an-than black artists because of the unwillingness to give blacks credit for their talent, and so white people in the jazz industrty got rich but blacks didn't reap the same benefits. A lot of black artists felt like they were being ripped off financially and recognition wise while white musicians who benefited from the talent of black musicians were labeled exploiters and for the financial gain they drew from the music they were called thieves</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: Yeah I can see that, rightfully so.</p>
            <p>HANNAH HARTUNG: Of course, and while jazz was being rejected in the United States a lot of black musicians were getting deals across seas and they found that the segregation wasn't widespead, their artistic ability was actually being acknowledged and encouraged. Og course, over time in the United States jazz created a sense of community and integration. The artists became seen as equals and interracial bands were created.</p>
            <p>KATIE ONG: I think thats really nice that, you know that eventually they kind of embraced it but thanks-thank you for tuning in and we will see you, never again bye bye.</p>
